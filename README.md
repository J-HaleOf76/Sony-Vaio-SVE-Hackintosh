## ⚙️ What's (not) working ?
<p>(Pretty much everything important works actually !)</p>

- ✅ <b>Integrated GPU (Intel HD Graphics 4000)</b>
- ✅ <b>Audio: both Internal Speakers/Headphones Jack</b> 
- ✅ <b>External Monitors (HDMI)</b>
- ✅ <b>Web Camera and Microphone</b>
- ✅ <b>USB 2.0/3.0</b>
- ✅ <b>Touchscreen (identified as a Magic Trackpad - let me tell you it's fu**ing amazing) - third party software needed, more details on that soon</b> 
- ✅ <b>Trackpad : much better support compared to my VPCSB model - Magic Trackpad Settings Panel, gestures and all... works as well</b>
- ✅ <b>Ethernet Connection</b>
- ✅ <b>Atheros WiFi (native WiFi panel)</b> 
- ✅ <b>Optical DVD Drive + Eject button</b>
- ✅ <b>Battery Meter and Status</b>
- ✅ <b>Display Brightness and Fn controls (sound + brightness)</b> 
- ⚠️ <b>Bluetooth (can't be disabled/enabled through software)</b>
- ⚠️ <b>Wake from Sleep - kinda works but fan goes to max speed on wake, could be related to the dedicated GPU (most likely) or a faulty temp. sensor on my HDD</b>
- ❌ <b>AirDrop - might need a better supported WiFi/BT card</b>
- ❌ <b>SD/M2 Duo Card Reader</b>
- ❌ <b>AMD/ATI Dedicated GPU (unsupported)</b>
- ❌ <b>VGA (unsupported or rarely supported)</b>
